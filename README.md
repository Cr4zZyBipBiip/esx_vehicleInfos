**// ESX_VEHICLEINFOS //**

**Introduction:**

"esx_vehicleInfos" is my first script that i share! It allows you to have informations about a vehicle in front of you! You have just have to look a vehicle and press "E" key.

There are 2 languages in the config file, **FR** and **EN**.

**How to install it:**

You only need ESX however this is a plug and play script. Put it in your resource folder and in your server.cfg and enjoy!

If you have any questions don't hesitate! Be indulgent, it's my first share!
